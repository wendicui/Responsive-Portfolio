			<p class = "clearfix">Trained in architecture for 8 years, focusing on design and working for an architectural contractor, I have been through the most imaginative conceptual field and the most hands-on down to earth aspect in the architectural business. Rewarding it can be, the long cycle time of archictures projects is an intrinsic delima. So I am looking for a change.  </p>
			<p>The extermest status to be an architect is to be in one in the <i>Inception</i>, appealing it might sound, I can not stay under for a life time long. So I am choosing to build in another way, to continue creation, expression. Just like the saying from Arhur in <i>Passanger</i>, who wants to sleep in a beautiul day like this? </p>
